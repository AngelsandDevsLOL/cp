A collection of all the code I've ever written for competitive programming. Majority of codes are finished and problems can be found on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/) (A few exceptions include USACO, AtCoder)

Sorted by packages, where the package name is generally the contest (NoContest is not a contest but general problems on DMOJ, package Random is from a contest that I did not see very often and decided not to make a folder for)

There may be duplicate files (Ex: Treehouse.java and Treehouse2.java), which represents 2 versions of code that I separately wrote to start from scratch (one of them probably won't work). 

Disclaimer: Some programs may be unfinished/doesn't work!

Everything is handwritten and typed.
