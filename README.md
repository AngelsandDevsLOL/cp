A collection of all the code I've ever written for competitive programming. Majority of codes are finished and problems can be found on [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/)  

Sorted by packages, where the package name is generally the contest (NoContest is not a contest but general problems on DMOJ)

Disclaimer: Some programs may be unfinished/doesn't work!
